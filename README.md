# Paython-package-to-model-tidal-stream
Build a python package to resolve primitive equation of the ocean in one dimension.

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in Building a python package using object oriented programing 
in order to solve primitive equation of the ocean in the vertical one-dimensional approximation.
